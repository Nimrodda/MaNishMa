# MaNishMa
#it's android app like whatsapp

MaNishMa is a WhatsApp like chat app based on Firebase Realtime Database. 
The main motivation behind this app is purely for learning purposes. Experimenting with different technologies, techniques and architectures. 

**This project is work in progress, mainly during my free time.**

### Architecture

The project attempts to adhere to the best practices in Android App development.

* MVVM is used as the architecture for the UI in combination with Android Data Binding library
* Each code package encapsulates a specific feature in the app
* Dagger Android is used for dependency injection
* Abstraction - services are abstracted using interfaces so they can be easily changed with Dagger. One example is `FirebaseMessagingService` under `realtimedb` branch, which is replaced by `XmppMessagingService` in other branches.
* Unit testing the model in isolation
* Espresso automated UI testing using Robot pattern

### Repository branches

This repository contains several branches. The one which is being actively developed is `realtimedb`.
The other branches are experiments that I've done with different architectures and technologies, such as:
* MVP vs MVVM
* Java vs Kotlin
* Firebase Realtime Database vs XMPP

etc.

### Build

You'll need Android Studio 3 beta 2 at the minimum to run it. You'll also need to attach your own `google-services.json` file from your Firebase project.
